        <div class="text-container"></div>
        <p>
          <span>What do Pablo Escobar’s escaped hippos in Colombia and cats in
            Antarctica have in common?</span> They are both declared invasive in their
          respective areas. <br />
          Invasive species are non-native species also referred to as alien
          species that cause ecological or economic harm in the new region, they
          live in. This species can be a microbe, plant, insect or an animal and
          not all alien species are invasive. Some can be domesticated or are kept
          in zoos. It is when such a group starts living on its own in the new
          area (becomes feral) and poses a significant threat to local species
          or starts causing damage to property, health and well being of people
          is when they are considered invasive. In the case of cats in
          Antarctica (it is not just Antarctica cats are invasive in)
          they were brought to Antarctica as pets of researchers and Pablo
          Escobar’s hippos were part of his private zoo. In both cases there has
          been significant damage caused to the local ecosystem. <br />
          At the root of all biological invasions is human travel and trade.
          Other factors like availability of perfect climate, easy source of
          food and a secure space for living facilitate growth in the population
          of that species. <br />
          According to IPBES (Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and
          Ecosystem Services) <span>over $423 billion</span> is the estimated global annual
          economic cost of dealing with problems associated with invasive
          species which is certainly a very high number! What leads to this
          becoming such a costly issue? Well, that depends on the species, the
          new habitat and several factors that have to come together to create
          an invasion. So let’s look at the journey of two species which have very
          interesting stories. The <span>Burmese Python</span> and the <span>Rock Dove</span> (known mainly as the pigeons we city dwellers see every single day).

The hurricane destroyed a python breeding facility that released them in neighbouring swamps. <br> The challenge of managing their population in the Everglades lies in the fact that the area is quite difficult to access.

              <div class="content">In the Everglades, they pose a threat to the native ecosystem. They outcompete native wildlife for food resources and can become resistant to predation as they grow very quickly. They also have a varied diet so several species can serve as a food source. Primarily mammalian (animals like raccoons, fox, rabbits, etc.) populations have seen a significant decline. Even an American Alligator can serve as prey or predator depending on the size of individuals. Another reason for their population growth is that a single female can lay a clutch of 20 - 50 eggs every year!</div>

                Like other invasive species, it’s important to distinguish between 
                where Rock Doves are native and where they’ve become invasive. But 
                with Rock Doves, there’s an added twist…genetics. These birds are the 
                wild ancestors of the feral pigeons we see thriving in cities today. 
                They’re the same species, but we call the wild/ native populations 
                Rock Doves, while the city-dwelling ones that live independently are
                Feral Pigeons.

                Domestication of Rock Doves over centuries has created significant 
                distinction in the genetics of these pigeons. Feral pigeons or pigeons 
                we see in cities are descendants of domesticated pigeons. They look 
                like their wild counterparts and but can have variation in colours.

                Rock dove are native to Europe, Northern Africa and Western Asia. 
                In its native regions the challenge is keeping the feral population 
                separate from the wild population. Feral pigeons can act as vectors 
                for diseases that can impact humans and livestock. While generally 
                they might not cause major diseases in humans, they can transmit 
                diseases to other native birds. They also outcompete native birds 
                with respect to food sources.  Pigeon droppings also cause 
                significant property damage.

                New York City are known for their pigeon populations. While laws are

            Once domesticated then feral and now urban the Rock Doves or
            pigeons are a feature of today's urban skies and invasive almost
            worldwide. Pigeons have a long history with humans and have become 
            a part of our urban cultures. So the case of pigeons introduces 
            the ‘cultural’ aspect to the problem of invasive species. <br>

        <h1>Global Impact</h1>
        <p>While invasive species do not follow political boundaries the 
          policies regarding the status and management of a species is 
          regulated by national laws. Factors that seem to contribute 
          to an alien species becoming invasive are trade, travel, presence of 
          appropriate climatic condition, an easy source of food and secure space 
          for living. Trade and travel result in the introduction of alien species 
          and the environment facilitates population growth. Some inherent qualities 
          of the species like being difficult to locate or quick adaptations tend 
          to also play a role.</p>

              Most of the top 15 countries with the highest number of invasive
              species also have the highest GDPs. So the link between number of 
              invasive species in a country with trade is further strengthened. 
              Islands like Réunion and New Caledonia also make the list probably 
              because island ecosystems are more closed off and sensitive to new species. 
              Countries like New Zealand and South Africa have a history of deliberate and 
              accidental introduction of alien species. They are also countries that have 
              regions with subtropical climate. South Africa is also ecologically very diverse,
              so programs have been developed to protect native ecological systems.

          on the horizontal axis, and the number of countries they are invasive 
          in on the vertical axis. The dots are colour coded into 4 categories 
          dividing species in clusters (Local Nuisance (invasive in few countries), 
          On the Radar (invasive in more than 15), Explorer (invasive in more than 38) 
          and Invasive Everywhere(invasive in over 85)).
        </p>
        <p>When we look for the species that is invasive in most countries, pigeons win the race 
          by being invasive in 184 countries (there are 195 countries in the world). <br>
          If we focus just on plants and animals, the types of species that most 
          often become invasive include flowering plants, vertebrates, and insects. 
          This makes sense as these are groups that humans interact with frequently, 
          and they can easily cause ecological or economic harm. <br>
          
          Interestingly, the cluster labelled “Invasive Everywhere” is also made up 
          mostly of flowering plants, vertebrates, and insects. Within this group, 
          there’s a wide range in how many countries each species has spread to, 
          which could suggest that these species have a long history of human 
          movement, trade, or use which gives them more chances to spread and 
          establish in new places.

        <h1>End of the Trail - For Now</h1>
        <p>Invasive species are a global problem but solutions require local 
          intervention and an understanding of factors influencing the 
          system. So first and foremost, awareness about this helps with preventing 
          creation of new invasions and further spread of existing ones. Prevention 
          is also the most low-cost way of managing this issue. <br>

          Since each invasion is different depending on the place, solving the 
          problem means understanding not just the local environment, but sometimes 
          the culture too. Learning from how other places have handled similar issues 
          can also be helpful. It’s important to understand the species involved, the 
          people affected, and to work with those who know the issue well (like 
          researchers, volunteers, and policymakers). Dealing with invasive species 
          can be risky, both for the people doing the work and the animals themselves. 
          That’s why it’s so important to have the right people and organizations 
          involved to find the most effective and humane solutions. <br>
          
          While we refer to this problem as ‘invasions’ they are a problem that 
          humans have created. Human activities are linked to all biological invasions. 
          So keeping this in mind when we think of all problems invasive species create 
          is also important.
